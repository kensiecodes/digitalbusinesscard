## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite boilerplate with React

I used Vite for the first time which has an incredibly quick and easy start up, and it automatically sets your $npm run dev to a local server so you can get to coding as quickly as possible. I loved this and will definitely continue using it in my future projects. I used what I've learned so far in React to build out the JSX file.

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Lessons Learned:

I used Figma to design and export the custom SVGs, and positioning them required position: relative; which I haven't used until now. I also used my own ::hover selector for the font-awesome buttons. For such a basic project, I feel like a lot of the skills I took from earlier projects informed this one very well.
