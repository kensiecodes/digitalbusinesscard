## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite boilerplate with React

I used Vite for the first time which has an incredibly quick and easy start up, and it automatically sets your $npm run dev to a local server so you can get to coding as quickly as possible. I loved this and will definitely continue using it in my future projects. I used what I've learned so far in React to build out the JSX file.

## Lessons Learned:

I used Figma to design and export the custom SVGs, and positioning them required position: relative; which I haven't used until now. I also used the ::hover selector for the first for the font-awesome buttons. I've made several projects with node, but this is my first with Vite. For such a basic project, I feel like a lot of the skills I took from earlier projects informed this one very well.
